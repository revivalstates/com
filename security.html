          Security Policy for Revival States
          At Revival States, we take security seriously to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all players. This Security Policy outlines the measures we take to protect the integrity of our server, safeguard player information, and prevent unauthorized activities.
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
             Data Protection and Privacy
            We implement various security measures to protect the personal data we collect from users, including:
            
            Encryption: Sensitive data (such as user credentials) is encrypted where necessary to ensure it is protected during transmission.
            Access Control: We limit access to personal data only to authorized staff members, who are required to maintain confidentiality.
            Monitoring: We continuously monitor our server for any suspicious activity or potential breaches.
            For further details on how we handle your personal information, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
          </li>
          <li>
             Account Security
            We expect players to take steps to secure their accounts, including:
            
            Strong Passwords: We encourage the use of strong, unique passwords to protect your account from unauthorized access.
            Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): If available, enable 2FA to add an additional layer of security to your account.
            Reporting Suspicious Activity: Immediately report any unauthorized access to your account to server administrators.
            We reserve the right to lock or temporarily disable accounts that appear to be compromised until ownership can be verified.
          </li>
          <li>
             Anti-Cheat and Exploit Prevention
            Maintaining fair play and preventing cheating is a top priority. To do this, we employ the following security measures:
            
            Anti-Cheat Software: We utilize anti-cheat software and scripts to detect and prevent the use of unauthorized third-party tools, cheats, or exploits that give players unfair advantages.
            Server Logs: We keep logs of player activity, including in-game actions, chat logs, and IP addresses, to help identify rule violations and suspicious behavior.
            Ban System: Players found using cheats, hacks, or exploits will face disciplinary actions, including temporary or permanent bans, depending on the severity of the infraction.
          </li>
          <li>
             Server Integrity
            To protect the server's integrity and prevent unauthorized access, we implement several technical and administrative measures:
            
            Firewall & DDoS Protection: We employ firewall configurations and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to prevent attacks that could disrupt the server.
            Regular Updates: Our server software, mods, and plugins are regularly updated to address vulnerabilities and improve performance.
            Access Control for Staff: Server administration and moderation tools are accessible only to authorized personnel, who have been trained in security best practices.
          </li>
          <li>
             Third-Party Services
            In some cases, we may use third-party services (such as Discord integration or game mods). While we strive to work only with secure and trustworthy partners, we are not responsible for the security practices of third-party services. We encourage you to review the security policies of any third-party services you interact with.
          </li>
          <li>
             Player Responsibility
            Players are expected to contribute to the security of the server by following these guidelines:
            
            Do Not Share Account Information: Never share your account login information with others. Your account is your responsibility, and any activity on your account will be treated as your own.
            Use Legitimate Software: Only use approved mods and scripts within the server. Avoid downloading or installing unauthorized software that could compromise your security or the integrity of the server.
            Report Vulnerabilities: If you discover any security vulnerabilities or bugs within the server, please report them immediately to the server administration.
          </li>
          <li>
             Incident Response
            In the event of a security breach, unauthorized access, or data compromise, we will take the following steps:
            
            Immediate Action: We will act quickly to identify and contain the breach, including disabling affected accounts or services if necessary.
            User Notification: If your personal information is compromised, we will notify you as soon as possible and provide guidance on securing your account.
            Investigation and Reporting: We will conduct an internal investigation to understand the cause of the breach and implement measures to prevent future incidents.
          </li>
          <li>
             Changes to the Security Policy
            We reserve the right to modify or update this Security Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted on our server website or in the relevant communication channels. Continued use of the server after changes have been posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Security Policy.
